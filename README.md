# Project Title: Explanatory Analysis (EDA) of Climate Change in the Philippines through the Years
***This repository is for our requirement in BAT404 - Analytics Techniques and Tools (IT 3206)***

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the world's issue right now where different places are having unexpected weather. This takes place during the mid-20th century, due to human activities such as deforestation, fossil fuels, mining, waste disposal and etc. Apparently, this actions are considered as challenges to human and the environment, and will continue in the future. Nowadays, there are some organizations or human activities that are making proactive adaptation and planning in order to ensure the sustainability of the development[^1][^2].

According to the Word Risk Report 2017, Philippines is the third country that is experiencing wide open climate change. The impact of this event is massive, including: changes in rainfall patterns, sea level rise, public health risk, losses in gross domestic product and endangerment of indigenous people and women[^3]. 2.83 million USD are spent by the Philippine government last 2015 for the climate change adaptation and mitigation, allocating 98 % of it for the adaptation while the remaining 2% is used for the mitigation. This is distributed into food security, water sufficiency, the ecology and environment, human security, climate-smart industries, sustainable energy, knowledge and capacity development, and finance but none of it had been allocated for health or spent in the health sector[^4]. Due to climate change, it is projected that the GDP growth in the Philippines would reduce to 0.9% by 2050. The global impact of climate change at the sectoral level on trade would result in higher prices and it would create an incentive for farmers to increase the production of their agricultural export commodities however, the local productivity effect reduces the production of agricultural commodities due to a reduction in yield for most of the crops, including rice.[^5]

The average temperature in the Philippines is around 24°- 27°C, the warmest month is May and the coldest month is January. Due to the mild trade breezes, lush vegetation, and frequent rainfall, the humid levels average is approximately 82%. However, the dry season starts at December to May, which follows the rainy season from June to November. From December to February, the eastern and northern coast experience a second rainy season. The location of the Philippines is most typhoon-prone area, encountering 19-20 typhoons each year and 7-9 landfalls. The Philippines' typhoon season is from July to October, where 70% of typhoons are form[^6].

According to the report of the Institute for Economics and Peace 2017, with the comparison of 1958 and 2014 the temperature in the Philippines increased by 0.62°C in yearly average mean temperature. As consequence, wet days became often from the recent decades because the intensity of rainfall increased[^6].


## Problem Statement
The Philippines is now the world's third most vulnerable country due to climate change. In the Philippines, climate change has many consequences, including annual GDP losses, changes in rainfall patterns and distribution, droughts, threats to biodiversity and food security, sea-level rise, public health risks, and endangering vulnerable groups like women and indigenous people. Droughts and floods are becoming more often as a result of climate change, reducing agricultural growth and output. Plants require an optimum soil-water-air environment at the root zone to sustain physiological growth responses, photosynthetic activities, and productive vegetative capacity for high yield. Climate change impacts many aspects of food production, including increased pests and disease in some areas, changes and even losses in biodiversity in other habitats, and significant disruptions due to extreme storm events, such as the destruction of crops in the Philippines by tropical cyclones[^8].

Climate change is already currently happening. Evidence suggests that the change cannot be explained only by natural variation. The most current scientific studies have shown that the observed warming of the climate system since the mid-twentieth century is most likely due to human actions, such as the use of fossil fuels and land-use change. Current warming poses significant difficulties to man and the environment and will continue to do so in the future. Some autonomous adaptation is currently taking place, but we must consider more proactive adaptation planning to ensure sustainable development[^9].

The Philippines has a high temperature and abundant rainfall, describing the humid tropical environment. The average annual rainfall is 2,348 millimeters (mm), but this varies widely, ranging from 960 mm in southeast Mindanao to nearly 4,050 mm in central Luzon. High temperatures are typical, particularly in the lowlands and plains, averaging 27°C all year. Humidity levels are high, averaging around 82 percent, due to the warm wet trade winds that blow over the archipelago, sea surface temperatures, a rich and vigorous vegetation cover, and abundant rainfall. The southwest monsoons dominate rainfall in the summer, whereas the northeast monsoon and tropical cyclones govern rainfall in the winter. Convective rainfall is expected due to the country's mountainous geography, which is interlaced with small coastal plains. The Philippines also endures severe droughts regularly. The hottest months in the Philippines are April and May, with the coldest months being December, January, and February. The yearly temperature is 27.1°C, with a seasonal temperature variation of approximately 3°C. Temperatures fluctuate widely across the nation with minimal variation. Where temperature discrepancies occur, such as at Baguio City, where the daily mean temperature is 19.6°C, elevation has a significant impact. Heavy rainfall is concentrated in the country's west from June to September, while heavy rainfall is concentrated in the east from October to March[^10].

The Philippines, as one of the world's most vulnerable countries, is dedicated to addressing the issue of climate change. It has signed both the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, both of which set objectives for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. In order to meet its national development goals and international duties, the Philippine government built robust legal and administrative frameworks for climate mitigation and adaptation. As a result of these laws and regulations, climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction initiatives have been incorporated into the Philippine Development Plan for 2017-2022.


## Significance of the Proposed Project

Climate change has had several noticeable effects on the Philippines over the years. From increasing temperature, the annual loss of GDP, drought, and changes in rainfall pattern. Evidence suggests that the change cannot be explained only by natural variation. According to the most recent scientific studies, the observed warming of the climate system since the mid-20th century is most likely due to human actions such as the use of fossil fuels and land-use change. This project's goal is to supply an explanatory analysis of Climate Change in the Philippines through the years. This project will provide a variety of data sets exemplifying climatic variations in the Philippines. This research will be useful for the following purposes:

**The Students**. For those students who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines' climatic change throughout time.

**The Teachers.** For teachers who will be teaching about climate change in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can be utilised in their courses.

**The Government Officials.** For selected government officials who will be needing data that they may use for their future project/s related to climate change. 

**The Future Researchers.** For the researchers to provide background knowledge concerning climatic change in the Philippines. This project's analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions.

 

## Methods
There have been studies on climate change challenges for poor nations, but it is the rising conversations and literature on climate issues in the Philippines that provide a chance to generate additional empirical data and understanding into this topic. As a result, conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an appropriate method of building on and exploring new research. The EDA focuses on doing an analysis of information on adaptation techniques in the Philippines setting and providing conclusions. It will also identify general patterns of climate change. 

  
## Expected Output
The goal of this project is to identify general patterns in the data that will help the researcher before making any assumptions. If the output of the analysis is proven and has some kind of relationship between the variables and at the same time if the output of the analysis is getting worst it can be used to spread awareness to lessen the variables that cause climate change, it also can help for further research to come up with a sufficient strategic plan. The government can also adapt and learn from the other countries that have successfully come up with a strategic plan in facing climate change. They can also raise awareness, especially among the younger generation, advocate a campaign, and make a program that can help in combating climate change.
