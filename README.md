# Project Title: Explanatory Analysis (EDA) of Climate Change in the Philippines through the Years
***This repository is for our requirement in BAT404 - Analytics Techniques and Tools (IT 3206)***

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the world's issue right now where different places are having unexpected weather. This takes place during the mid-20th century, due to human activities such as deforestation, fossil fuels, mining, waste disposal and etc. Apparently, this actions are considered as chellenges to human and the environment, and will continue in the future. Nowadays, there are some organizations or human activities that are making proactive adaptation and planning in order to ensure the sustainability of the development.[^1][^2]

According to the Word Risk Report 2017, Philippines is the third country that is experiencing wide open climate change. The impact of this event is massive, including: changes in rainfall patterns, sea level rise, public health risk, losses in gross domestic prouct and endagerment of indigeneous people and women.[^3]

The avarage temperature in the Philippines is around 24°- 27°C, the warmest month is May and the coldest month is January. Due to the mild trade breezes, lush vegetatio, and frequent rainfalll, the humid levels average is approximately 82%. However, the dry season starts at December to May, which follows the rainy season from June to November. From December to February, the eastern and northern coast experience a second rainy season. The locoation of the Philippines is most typhoon-prone area, encountering 19-20 typhoons each year and 7-9 landfalls. The Philippines' typhoon season is from July to October, where 70% of typhoons are form. [^4]

According to the report of the Institute for Economics and Peace 2017, with the comparison of 1958 and 2014 the temperature in the Philippines increased by 0.62°C in yearly averange mean temperature. As consequence, intensity of rainfall increased, which resulted to more rainy days in the recent decades. [^4]


## Problem Statement
The Philippines is now the world's third most vulnerable country due to climate change. In the Philippines, climate change has a wide range of consequences, including annual GDP losses, changes in rainfall patterns and distribution, droughts, threats to biodiversity and food security, sea level rise, public health risks, and endangering vulnerable groups like women and indigenous people. Climate change is already currently happening. Evidence suggests that the change cannot be explained only by natural variation. The most current scientific studies have shown that the observed warming of the climate system since the mid-twentieth century is most likely due to human actions, such as the use of fossil fuels and land use change. Current warming is posing significant difficulties to man and the environment, and will continue to do so in the future. Some autonomous adaptation is currently going place, but in order to ensure sustainable development, we must consider more proactive adaptation planning.[^5]

Droughts and floods are becoming more often as a result of climate change, reducing agricultural development and output. Plants require an ideal soil-water-air environment in the root zone to support physiological growth responses, photosynthetic functions, and productive vegetative capacity for high yield response. Climate change is influencing various areas of food production, such as increased pests and disease in some settings, changes and even losses in biodiversity in other habitats, and substantial disruptions due to extreme storm events, such as the destruction of crops in the Philippines by typhoons.

The Philippines has a humid equatorial climate with high temperatures and abundant rains. The average annual rainfall is 2,348 millimeters (mm), but this varies widely, ranging from 960 mm in southeast Mindanao to nearly 4,050 mm in central Luzon. Temperatures are often high, especially in the valleys and plains, averaging 27°C all year. Because of the warm wet trade winds that blow over the archipelago, as well as sea surface temperatures, a rich and vigorous vegetation cover, and ample rainfall, humidity levels are high, average around 82 percent. The southwest monsoons dominate rainfall in the summer, whereas the northeast monsoon and tropical cyclones govern rainfall in the winter. Because of the country's mountainous geography, which is interlaced with tiny coastal plains, convective rainfall is widespread. The Philippines also endures severe droughts on a regular basis, which are linked to the El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The hottest months in the Philippines are April and May, with the coldest months being December, January, and February. The average annual temperature is 27.1°C, with a seasonal temperature range of about 3°C. Temperatures vary across the country with little change. Elevation is a crucial effect where temperature disparities exist, such as in Baguio City, where the daily mean temperature is 19.6°C. Precipitation distribution varies geographically: from June to September, heavy rainfall is concentrated in the west of the country, whereas from October to March, heavy rainfall is concentrated in the country's eastern areas. A 0.62°C increase in yearly average mean temperature between 1958 and 2014, as well as a large increase in the number of hot days and warm nights across the country between 1960 and 2003. The average annual rise for maximum temperature is 0.008°C and for minimum temperature is 0.019°C.[^6]

The Philippines, as one of the world's most vulnerable countries, is dedicated to addressing the issue of climate change. It has signed both the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, both of which set objectives for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The Philippine government built major legislative and administrative structures for climate mitigation and adaptation in order to satisfy its national development goals and international obligations. Climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction efforts have been included into the Philippine Development Plan for 2017-2022 as a result of these laws and policies.


## Significance of the Proposed Project


Climate change has had several noticeable effects on the Philippines over the years. From increasing temperature, annual loss of GDP, drought, and changes in rainfall pattern. Evidence suggests that the change cannot be explained only by natural variation. The most current scientific studies have shown that the observed warming of the climate system since the mid-20th century is most likely due to human actions, such as the use of fossil fuels and land use change. This project's goal is to supply an explanatory analysis of the Climate Change in the Philippines through the years.

**The Students**. For those students who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines' climatic change throughout time.

**The Teachers.** For teachers who will be teaching about climate change in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can be utilised in their courses.

**The Government Officials.** For selected government officials who will be needing data that they may use for their future project/s related to climate change. 

**The Future Researchers.** For the researchers to provide background knowledge concerning climatic change in the Philippines. This project's analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions.

 

## Methods
There have been studies on climate change challenges for poor nations, but it is the rising conversations and literature on climate issues in the Philippines that provide a chance to generate additional empirical data and understanding into this topic. As a result, conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an appropriate method of building on and exploring new research. The EDA focuses on doing an analysis of information on adaptation techniques in the Philippines setting and providing conclusions. It will also identify general patterns of climate change. 

  
## Expected Output
With the help of EDA which is an analysis approach that identifies general patterns in the data, it will help the researcher to look at the data before making any assumptions. If the analysis of climate change in the Philippines through the years are proven and have some kind of relationship between the variables and if the result of the analysis is getting worst it can be used to spread an awareness to lessen the variables that cause climate change. It also can help for further research to come up a sufficient strategic plan. The government officials can have a meeting to strategized a plan to lessen climate change, they can raise an awareness especially to the younger generation, advocate a campaign, make a program that can help or the government officials can also adapt and learn from the other countries who have successfully come up a strategic plan in facing climate change.
