# Project Title: Explanatory Analysis (EDA) of Climate Change in the Philippines through the Years
***This repository is for our requirement in BAT404 - Analytics Techniques and Tools (IT 3206)***

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most basic issues that humanity has ever faced. Its negative effects are already being seen, and they are expected to worsen exponentially if nothing is done to curb additional greenhouse gas emissions. Dealing decisively with climate change now is critical to ensure sustainable development, poverty eradication, and economic progress. According to scientific analysis, the cost of inactivity today will be higher in the future.

According to the 2017 World Risk Report, the Philippines is the third most susceptible country to climate change. Climate change has had a massive impact on the Philippines, including yearly GDP losses, changes in rainfall patterns and distribution, droughts, challenges to biodiversity and food security, sea level rise, public health hazards, and endangering vulnerable populations such as women and indigenous people.

The average temperature in the Philippines is 24°–27°C all year, with May being the warmest month and January being the coldest. Because to mild trade breezes, rich vegetation, and frequent rainfall, humidity levels average approximately 82 %. However, the dry season lasts from December to May, followed by the rainy season from June to November. From December through February, the eastern and northern coast experience a second rainy season. The Philippines is located in the world's most cyclone-prone area, with an average of 19–20 cyclones each year, 7–9 of which make landfall. The Philippines' typhoon season lasts from July to October, when 70% of typhoons form.

Based on the Institute for Economics and Peace's 2019 study, the Philippines is the country most susceptible to climate change. The Philippines had a 0.62°C increase in yearly average mean temperature between 1958 and 2014, with the rate of change rising with time. Climate change has increased the volume and intensity of rainfall, resulting in more wet days in recent decades.


## Problem Statement
Climate change has made the Philippines the third most vulnerable country on the world. Climate change has a wide range of consequences in the Philippines, including annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) losses, changes in rainfall patterns and distribution, droughts, threats to biodiversity and food security, sea level rise, public health risks, and endangering vulnerable groups like women and indigenous people. Climate change is happening now. Evidences being seen support the fact that the change cannot simply be explained by natural variation. The most recent scientific assessments have confirmed that this warming of the climate system since the mid-20th century is most likely to be due to human activities; and thus, is due to the observed increase in greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and land use change. Current warming has increasingly posed quite considerable challenges to man and the environment, and will continue to do so in the future. Presently, some autonomous adaptation is taking place, but we need to consider a more pro-active adaptation planning in order to ensure sustainable development.

Droughts and floods are becoming more often as a result of climate change, which has a detrimental influence on agricultural growth and yields. To sustain physiological response to growth, photosynthetic functions, and productive vegetative capacity for high yield response, plants require an optimal soil-water-air environment in the root zone. Climate Change is affecting other aspects of crop production such as increased pests and disease in some situations, changes and even losses in biodiversity in some environments, and major disruptions due to extreme storm events, such as the decimation by the typhoons in the Philippines.

The Philippines has a humid equatorial climate characterized by high temperatures and heavy rainfall. Average annual rainfall is approximately 2,348 millimeters (mm), but this varies geographically, from 960 mm in southeast Mindanao to over 4,050 mm in central Luzon. Temperatures are generally high, particularly in the valleys and plains, averaging 27°C throughout the year. Humidity levels are high, averaging around 82% due to the warm moist trade winds that flow through the archipelago, as well as sea surface temperatures, a rich and vibrant vegetative cover and abundant rainfall. Rainfall is governed by the southwest monsoons in the summer months, and by the northeast monsoon and tropical cyclones in the winter. Convective rainfall is common due to the country’s mountainous terrain, interspersed with narrow coastal plains. The Philippines also experiences strong periodic droughts that are linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The Philippines’ hottest months are April and May, with the coldest months experienced during December, January and February. The mean annual temperature is 27.1°C, with a relatively low seasonal temperature variation of approximately 3°C. There is minimal spatial variation in temperatures across the country. Where temperature differences do exist, such as in Baguio City where the daily mean temperature is 19.6°C, elevation is significant factor. There is geographical variation in the distribution of precipitation: during June to September heavy rainfall is concentrated to the west of the country, whereas between October and March, heavy rainfall is predominantly found in the country’s eastern regions. A rise of 0.62°C in annual average mean temperature between 1958-2014 and a significant increase in the number of hot days and warm nights throughout the country between 1960-2003. Average increase per year for maximum temperature at 0.008°C and minimum temperature at 0.019°C.

The Philippines, as one of the world's most vulnerable countries, is dedicated to addressing the issue of climate change. It is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol and a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, both of which set objectives for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Philippine government built critical legislative and institutional structures for climate mitigation and adaptation in the country to accomplish its national development goals and international obligations. Climate change mitigation and catastrophe risk reduction initiatives have been incorporated in the Philippine Development Plan for 2017-2022, guided by these laws and plans.


## Significance of the Proposed Project


Climate change has had several noticeable effects on the Philippines over the years. From increasing temperature, annual loss of GDP, drought, and changes in rainfall pattern. Evidence suggests that the change cannot be explained only by natural variation. The most current scientific studies have shown that the observed warming of the climate system since the mid-20th century is most likely due to human actions, such as the use of fossil fuels and land use change. This project's goal is to supply an explanatory analysis of the Climate Change in the Philippines through the years.

**The Students**. For those students who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines' climatic change throughout time.

**The Teachers.** For teachers who will be teaching about climate change in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can be utilised in their courses.

**The Government Officials.** For selected government officials who will be needing data that they may use for their future project/s related to climate change. 

**The Future Researchers.** For the researchers to provide background knowledge concerning climatic change in the Philippines. This project's analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions.

 

## Methods
Understanding climate and its variability is the first step toward figuring out what factors influence the climate system's mean state, evolution, and future changes. To identify general patterns in the data, we used Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

  
## Expected Output
With the help of EDA which is an analysis approach that identifies general patterns in the data, it will help the researcher to look at the data before making any assumptions. If the analysis of climate change in the Philippines through the years are proven and have some kind of relationship between the variables and if the result of the analysis is getting worst it can be used to spread an awareness to lessen the variables that cause climate change. It also can help for further research to come up a sufficient strategic plan. The government officials can have a meeting to strategized a plan to lessen climate change they can raise an awareness especially to the younger generation, advocate a campaign, make a program that can help or the government officials can also adapt and learn from the other countries who have successfully come up a strategic plan.
