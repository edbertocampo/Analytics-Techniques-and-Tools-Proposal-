## Introduction
Climate change is one of the world's issue right now where different places are having unexpected weather. This takes place during the mid-20th century, due to human activities such as deforestation, fossil fuels, mining, waste disposal and etc. Apparently, this actions are considered as challenges to human and the environment, and will continue in the future. Nowadays, there are some organizations or human activities that are making proactive adaptation and planning in order to ensure the sustainability of the development[^1][^2].

The pearl of the orient sea also known as the Philippines are consists of approximately 7100 island, which is divided into three major island: the Luzon, Visayas, and MIndanao. The country's climate is influenced by trhe large-scale of atmospheric phenomena that brings a significant value of rains. However, the country's water resources are aldready having imbalance in supply and demand due to the occurrence of extreme events like flood and droughts (Jose et al. 1993). The increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is predicted to cause global warming. Climate change is predicted to rise global surgace temperatures by at least 2.0°C over the next century (IPCC 1996a)[^3][^4].

Rainfall patterns and temperatures are expected to shift dramatically over time and space as a result of global warming. Extreme weather events have harmed the Philippine economy over the last few decades. One of the most vulnerable countries to climate change's effects is the Philippines. Temperature and precipitation changes brought on by global warming are expected to have the greatest impact on the United States. Even though the increase in Pacific-originated tropical cyclone frequency and intensity isn't definitive, the United States has been hit by three of the gustiest storms ever recorded here in the last two decades, including Typhoon Haiyan. People in the Philippines' health and the health of their food supply are at risk as a result of climate change, according to a recent study on the Philippines. Temperature-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and dehydration, are expected to continue to rise as a result of climate change[^5].

In addition to sea level rise, rising temperatures, and extreme rainfall, the Philippines is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Natural hazards (cyclones, landslides, flooding, droughts) and reliance on climate-sensitive natural resources are to blame for the country's vulnerability to natural disasters. Many people's livelihoods are supported by a rich but increasingly depleted natural and marine resources base that provides essential ecosystem services such as shoreline protection and flood control and soil stability and habitats for biodiversity. Energy-related emissions in the Philippines account for more than half of all greenhouse gas emissions, with the remainder coming from agriculture, industrial processes, waste, and land-use/forestry changes[^6].



According to the report of the Institute for Economics and Peace 2017, with the comparison of 1958 and 2014 the temperature in the Philippines increased by 0.62°C in yearly average mean temperature. As consequence, wet days became often from the recent decades because the intensity of rainfall increased[^7].

![SDG11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102471784/170030098-9af2177f-6e48-4a81-8385-e993d18ae7c5.jpg)
![SDG13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102471784/170030142-59ff8db3-335a-4b5b-9f78-1486b82e9aa3.jpg)

To sum up, this analysis focuses on the eleventh (11) and thirteenth (13) SDG which is the sustainable cities and communities and climate action. The objective of this analysis is to observe the changes of the Philippine temperature. The datasets are from **Climate Change Knowledge Portal** which will guide the analysis to procure the requisite of the yearly changes from 1901 - 2020. This study will be the evidence that if the Filipino will consistently neglect the nature it will cause an extreme climate change in the future.


## Problem Statement
Climate change is already taking place. Natural variation alone cannot account for the shift, as per the evidence.  The majority of recent scientific research have concluded that the observed warming is due to natural causes, at the middle of the twentieth century, the human actions such as the use of fossil fuels and land usage, are most likely to blame. Mankind and the environment are both facing tremendous challenges as a result of current global warming and will keep doing so in the upcoming years. While some self-adaptation is occurring now, we must consider more proactive adaptation planning to assure long-term growth. According to the World Bank (2013), the Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, subject to typhoons, storm surges, drought, sea-level rise, and tsunamis[^8].

As a result of climate change, the Philippines is currently the world's third most susceptible country. Climate change has several impacts in the Philippines:rainfall patterns and distribution have changed, biodiversity and food security threats, sea-level rise, and putting vulnerable groups such as women and indigenous peoples at jeopardy. According to Sustainable Development Goals (2019), droughts and floods are two of the most common natural disasters, putting even more strain on the resources we rely on. It's reducing agricultural growth and output. To maintain physiological growth responses and productive vegetative capacity for high yield responses, plants require a balanced soil, water, and air environment at the root zone[^9]. According to Agrawal (2010) and Tompkins(2014), climate change is possibly society's greatest issue since it is a global phenomena with various local repercussions on people and places. These consequences will exacerbate with time, necessitating long-term planning and policy responses that extend far beyond the typical human lifetime and political horizon. Although historically, adaptation planning and policy have mostly centered on the national level, attention to adaptation at the local level has grown in importance over the last decade[^10][^11].

The Philippines has a high temperature and abundant rainfall, describing the humid tropical environment. The annual rainfall average is 2,348 millimeters(mm). However, it obviously differs, spanning from 960 millimetres in southeastern Mindanao to almost 4,050 millimetres in Luzon. Avg of 27°C all year, are normal, particularly in the lowlands and plains. Because to the warm wet trade breezes over the area, ocean temperatures, a thick and dense plant cover, and adequate rainfall, relative humidity remains high, with such an average of 82%. Summer rains is dominated by the southwest monsoons, whereas in the cold season, rainfall is governed by the northeast monsoon and tropical cyclones. According to Barreda (2018), the Philippines is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change since it is strongly reliant on climate-sensitive economic operations such as agriculture and has little resources for adaptation. Developing nations, such as the Philippines, are more sensitive to the effects of climate change because they have fewer means to adapt socially, technologically, and financially. As a result, it is expected that developing nations would experience the far-reaching consequences of climate change, particularly on their ability to achieve sustainable development, with youth being one of the areas most affected[^12].

As one of the most vulnerable countries on the planet, the Philippines is dedicated to tackling the problem of global warming. In order to achieve national development goals and fulfill international obligations, for climate prevention and adaptation, the Philippine government established strong legislative and administrative structures. In the years 2017 to 2022, climate change prevention and catastrophic risk reduction activities have been integrated into the Philippine Development Plan.



## Significance of the Proposed Project

Climate change has had several noticeable effects on the Philippines over the years. From increasing temperature, annual loss of GDP, drought, and changes in rainfall pattern. The proof demonstrates that change cannot be elucidated solely by natural variation. As reported by the recent scientific studies, the noticeable increase of temperature in the climate system since the time of the mid-20th century is conceivably because of different actions made by humans including the usage of fossil fuels, and land use change. This project's goal is to supply an explanatory analysis of the Climate Change in the Philippines through the years[^2]. This project will provide a variety of data sets exemplifying climatic variations in the Philippines. This research will be useful for the following purposes:

**The Students**. For those students who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines' climatic change throughout time.

**The Teachers.** For teachers who will be teaching about climate change in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can be utilised in their courses.

**The Government Officials.** For selected government officials who will be needing data that they may use for their future project/s related to climate change. 

**The Future Researchers.** For the researchers to provide background knowledge concerning climatic change in the Philippines. This project's analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions.

 

## Methods
There have been studies on climate change challenges for poor nations, but it is the rising conversations and literature on climate issues in the Philippines that provide a chance to generate additional empirical data and understanding into this topic. As a result, conducting an empirical research is an appropriate method of building on and exploring new research. This focuses on doing an analysis of information on adaptation techniques in the Philippines setting and providing conclusions. It will also identify general patterns of climate change.

  
## Expected Output
The goal of this project is to identify general patterns in the data that will help the researcher before making any assumptions [^13]. If the output of the analysis is proven and has some kind of relationship between the variables and at the same time if the output of the analysis is getting worst it can be used to spread awareness to lessen the variables that cause climate change, it also can help for further research to come up with a sufficient strategic plan. The government can also adapt and learn from the other countries that have successfully come up with a strategic plan in facing climate change. They can also raise awareness, especially among the younger generation, advocate a campaign, and make a program that can help in combating climate change[^14].
