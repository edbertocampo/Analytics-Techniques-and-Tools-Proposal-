# Project Title: Explanatory Analysis (EDA) of Climate Change in the Philippines through the Years
***This repository is for our requirement in BAT404 - Analytics Techniques and Tools (IT 3206)***

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most basic issues that humanity has ever faced. Its negative effects are already being seen, and they are expected to worsen exponentially if nothing is done to curb additional greenhouse gas emissions. Dealing decisively with climate change now is critical to ensure sustainable development, poverty eradication, and economic progress. According to scientific analysis, the cost of inactivity today will be higher in the future.

According to the 2017 World Risk Report, the Philippines is the third most susceptible country to climate change. Climate change has had a massive impact on the Philippines, including yearly GDP losses, changes in rainfall patterns and distribution, droughts, challenges to biodiversity and food security, sea level rise, public health hazards, and endangering vulnerable populations such as women and indigenous people.

The average temperature in the Philippines is 24°–27°C all year, with May being the warmest month and January being the coldest. Because to mild trade breezes, rich vegetation, and frequent rainfall, humidity levels average approximately 82 %. However, the dry season lasts from December to May, followed by the rainy season from June to November. From December through February, the eastern and northern coast experience a second rainy season. The Philippines is located in the world's most cyclone-prone area, with an average of 19–20 cyclones each year, 7–9 of which make landfall. The Philippines' typhoon season lasts from July to October, when 70% of typhoons form.

Based on the Institute for Economics and Peace's 2019 study, the Philippines is the country most susceptible to climate change. The Philippines had a 0.62°C increase in yearly average mean temperature between 1958 and 2014, with the rate of change rising with time. Climate change has increased the volume and intensity of rainfall, resulting in more wet days in recent decades.

## Significance of the Proposed Project
This study aims to provide an explanatory analysis of Climate Change in the Philippines through the years. This project will provide a variety of data sets illustrating climatic variations in the Philippines. This study will be beneficial for:

**The Students**. For those students who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines' climatic change throughout time.

**The Teachers.** For teachers who will be teaching about climate change in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can be utilised in their courses.
